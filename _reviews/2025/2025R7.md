Very long title, but that's not why it gets 3.5 stars. It's G-rated and cute story with a new way to use a familiar plot. It should have been 4 stars, maybe even more, except the writers decided to make her over-react to the "trust" issue. They should have made her more appreciative of what he did to get them that far and maybe even of him which would have inspired him to go even further. That's one better approach. So, 3.5 stars, not 4.
