Absolutely terrible! Zero stars (wish I could go negative). Terrible, horrible, not good, time wasted, pathetic, garbage ... bad plot, bad dialogue, bad casting choices, bad acting, bad humor. Just bad. 
I'll add to that. Too many green screens, bad acting, fake laughing, stupidness and NO, grapes can't grow on dead vines in the winter!!!
